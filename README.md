## Realtime Quality Assurance

This tool was developed to provide our agency with a realtime QA tool. It currently resides on the free heroku plan and is running fine.

## Road Map

	- Remove Bugherd Dependency
	- Remove Pusher Depedency
	- Build Visual QA into the Tool
	- Upload Assets for QA
	- Email Notifications for Open Issues
